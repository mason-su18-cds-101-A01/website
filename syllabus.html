              <p>During this course, students will develop basic skills for obtaining, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing real-world datasets using the R programming language and the RStudio integrated development environment. Statistical methods for
                analyzing, interpreting, and predicting dataset trends are then introduced and approached from a computational point of view using randomization and simulation. Additional topics may be covered, such as an introduction to advanced or special
                topics like cross-validation. Throughout the course emphasis is placed on documenting one’s scientific work using RStudio in conjunction with Github to fulfill the principles of reproducible research. Connections are highlighted between
                statistical inference and the scientific method and how this is related to both the scientific method’s power and its limitations. These tools will also be used to critically examine statistical claims reported in mass media, demonstrating
                how scientific literacy and a basic knowledge in statistics are indispensable tools to making sense of our modern&nbsp;world.</p>

              <h3 id="software">Software</h3>
              <p>During the course, we will use the following free and open-source software to manipulate data, perform computations, and write&nbsp;documents:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Programming language: R (
                  <a href="https://www.r-project.org" class="uri">https://www.r-project.org</a>)</li>
                <li>Version control: Git (
                  <a href="https://git-scm.com" class="uri">https://git-scm.com</a>)</li>
                <li><span class="caps">PDF</span> export: LaTeX (
                  <a href="https://www.latex-project.org" class="uri">https://www.latex-project.org</a>)</li>
                <li>Programming software: RStudio (
                  <a href="https://www.rstudio.com" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com</a>)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>RStudio sits on top of R, Git, and LaTeX and provides a user-friendly interface to using these programs. You can think of R, Git, and LaTeX as plugins that activate RStudio’s main features. In practice, RStudio is the software application
                that we will learn to use during the&nbsp;course.</p>
              <p><em>Students are highly encouraged to use Anaconda (<a href="https://anaconda.com" class="uri">https://anaconda.com</a>) to install the latest version of R, RStudio, and its other&nbsp;dependencies.</em></p>
              <h3 id="platforms">Platforms</h3>
              <p>The course will be administered through the following online&nbsp;platforms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Course website (
                  <a href="http://spring18.cds101.com" class="uri">http://spring18.cds101.com</a>)</li>

                <li>Slack (

              </ul>
              <p>The course website operates as the central repository for course materials, including an up-to-date schedule and posted slides and handouts. Slack is the primary communication medium, replacing email (see the
                <a href="#contact-policy">Contact policy</a> below) and serving as a discussion board. Github is used for storing your classroom files, distributing and collecting homework assignments, handing out example code, and for project collaborations.Blackboard will be
                used for posting&nbsp;grades.</p>

              <h3 id="contact-policy">Contact&nbsp;policy</h3>
              <p><em>All</em> correspondence is to be done using the private, invite-only Slack workspace for the course. Direct messages on Slack are to be used for contacting me instead of emails. Your Slack username <em>must</em> be registered and associated
                with your Mason <code>@gmu.edu</code> email address at all&nbsp;times.</p>
              <p>My ground rules for direct messages are as&nbsp;follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I check and respond to messages during normal university&nbsp;hours.</li>
                <li>Allow up to approximately 24 hours for a response during normal&nbsp;hours.</li>
                <li>Just because I view a message does not mean I will respond right&nbsp;away.</li>
                <li>I generally don’t respond to messages over weekends and school&nbsp;holidays.</li>
                <li>If your questions are involved enough, I will ask you to come to office hours or schedule a Skype&nbsp;chat.</li>
                <li><em>On email:</em> During the first two weeks of the course, emails will be responded to, but I will send you my response on Slack. After two weeks, emails will be ignored.

                cannot be made up. Unexcused absences, frequent tardiness, or leaving class early will reduce your participation&nbsp;grade.</p>
              <p>Absences due to religious holidays, scheduled varsity sports trips, and short-term illnesses should be brought to my attention as early as possible. Any make-up work is to be completed within 24 hours. Exemptions may be granted at my&nbsp;discretion.</p>

              <p>Unless otherwise noted, the main homework assignments are to be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date. The following penalties apply for most assignments (please note that weekends count as&nbsp;days):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>First day late, by 11:59pm:&nbsp;-10%</li>
                <li>Second day late, by 11:59pm:&nbsp;-20%</li>

              </ul>
              <p>The above does not pertain to the reading questions and answers, which must be submitted before the posted date and time to receive credit. The writeup for the midterm project and your final course portfolio are also exceptions and must
                be submitted by the due date; late submissions will not be&nbsp;accepted.</p>
              <p>Presentations, such as for the midterm project or the final interview, must be given on the scheduled date and cannot be made&nbsp;up.</p>
              <p>Extensions or exemptions may be granted in the case of illness or a family emergency at my discretion, and it is the student’s responsibility to inform me about these kinds of circumstances as soon as&nbsp;possible.</p>

              <p>Regrade appeals need to be in writing, printed out, and hand delivered to me within 48 hours of receiving back an assignment (not including weekends). Appeals via Slack or email will not be accepted, no exceptions. Appeals are only to be
                used for correct answers being marked as incorrect, misapplication of the grading rubric, or incorrectly tallied points. Submissions need to clearly state what you want regraded and to justify the request by citing evidence

              <h2 id="course-expectations" data-magellan-target="course-expectations">Expectations</h2>
              <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
              <p>Students are expected to come to class prepared. Most course topics will require some amount of programming, which is a skill that’s best learned by doing. In-class activities and exercises will be provided to re-enforce these concepts,
                which at times may be completed in pairs or in groups. Students are expected to give their full effort while completing an in-class exercise and to complete it within a reasonable timeframe. A combination of speed of completion and quality
                of work will be factored into your participation grade. A student’s number of absences during the semester will also factor into his/her participation&nbsp;grade.</p>
              <h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>
              <p>Reading assignments will be regularly scheduled during the semester. They will be posted on the course schedule with reminders sent via Slack. Students are to complete the reading assignments by the specified date and be able to discuss
                it in&nbsp;class.</p>
              <p>To help foster discussion of the reading assignments, students will be required to post one question per reading on Slack. Posting more than one question per reading is encouraged. Students are also required to reply to at least 10 questions
                during the semester and provide an answer. These replies need to be spread out so that questions are answered throughout the course. As such, a bare minimum of 5 answers need to be posted between January 23rd and March 9th, and another
                minimum of 5 answers need to be posted between March 19th and May&nbsp;4th.</p>
              <p>Some additional rules about the reading&nbsp;posts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All questions and answers for the reading are to be posted in the <code>#4-discussion</code> channel.</li>
                <li>Your question and answer posts <strong>must</strong> be labeled to tell us which assignment they’re for.
                  <ul>
                    <li>For example, use <code>#reading2</code> if you’re posting about the 2nd assigned&nbsp;reading.</li>
                    <li>Include <code>#question</code> for a question post and <code>#answer</code> for an answer&nbsp;post.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When responding to a question, use&nbsp;“reply”.</li>
                <li>Questions must be posted by the due date to be eligible for&nbsp;credit.</li>
                <li>Answers can be posted up to 48 hours after the “read-by” due&nbsp;date.</li>
                <li>Question and answer quality&nbsp;matters.</li>
                <li>Avoid Q/A&nbsp;duplications</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
              <p>There will be 5 main homework assignments to complete during the semester. Smaller, shorter mini-assignments may also be distributed from time to time. Assignments will be submitted to Github as a new pull&nbsp;request.</p>
              <p>Assignments submissions are documents consisting of interwoven segments of writing and code blocks. It is expected that you will write in full sentences and use proper grammar and punctuation. You will be expected to explain what you are
                doing with each chunk of code and to interpret the meaning of what you calculate. The document’s style and formatting will also be taken into account during grading and should follow the course’s style guides for R and&nbsp;RMarkdown.</p>
              <p>Students will be permitted to resubmit 1 of their assignments during the semester within a week of receiving their grade on the original assignment. The resubmissions are eligible to receive full credit and replace the lower grade. The updated
                assignment is to be submitted as a new pull request with a title that begins with the word <strong>Resubmission</strong>.</p>
              <p>Students may discuss homework assignments using the <code><i class="fas fa-lock"></i>sp18-homework</code> Slack channel. Take care to ensure that the final submission is in your own words. See the academic integrity section for&nbsp;specifics.</p>
              <h3 id="midterm-project">Midterm&nbsp;project</h3>
              <p>Students will complete a midterm project in assigned groups during the first half of the semester. For this project, you will perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset, focusing on “wrangling” the data so that you can produce meaningful
                visualizations and interpret basic trends. More detailed information about the project will be provided in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>
              <h3 id="final-project">Final&nbsp;project</h3>
              <p>In lieu of a traditional final exam, students will be building a portfolio containing both comprehensive notes on the major R functions used during the course and an overview of accomplishments demonstrating a student’s learning and growth
                over the semester. Students will also be given a couple of simulations to run, and then compare and contrast. Templates for the format and content of the notes portion of the portfolio will be provided in the first few weeks and will be
                gradually built throughout the semester. Students will then submit their portfolio about one week before the scheduled final&nbsp;exam.</p>
              <p>During the scheduled final exam, I will conduct a brief 5-10 minute interview with each student based on their portfolio submission. The interview will also contain a short exercise to complete. More information on both the portfolio and
                the final interview will be provided in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>

              <p>Students may discuss non-group work outside of class, however in all instances it is required that your submitted responses to assignments are written in your own words. Do not duplicate or paraphrase another person’s material or ideas and
                represent them as your own. Content that comes from a resource or another student should be properly&nbsp;cited.</p>
              <p>A note on sharing or reusing code found on other Github repos or on websites like <em>Wikipedia</em> or <em>Stack Overflow</em>. I am aware that there are solution sets, sample snippets of code, etc. that can be of use while working on your
                assignments, projects and exercises during the course. It’s common knowledge that researchers in both industry and academia will use search engines while writing code. Being able to search for existing solutions so that you don’t “reinvent
                the wheel” is a useful skill. Therefore, unless I specify otherwise, you are permitted to use these resources as long as you provide a&nbsp;citation.</p>
              <p>Exceptions to this rule&nbsp;are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For individual assignments, you cannot reuse another student’s&nbsp;code</li>
                <li>For group assignments, you cannot reuse another group’s&nbsp;code</li>

                <li>Showing up to class on&nbsp;time</li>

                <li>Removing ear-buds/headphones and sunglasses when class&nbsp;begins</li>

              <p>The expectations of civil and respectful behavior still apply for all online discussions Students are expected to follow proper grammar and punctuation in online posts and to refrain from using internet slang, abbreviations, and&nbsp;sarcasm.</p>
              <p>I will address violations of classroom decorum on a case-by-case basis and reserve the right to enact grade-based penalties for highly disruptive or repeat violations. Penalties for decorum violations cannot be negotiated or&nbsp;appealed.</p>

              <p>George Mason University promotes a living and learning environment for outstanding growth and productivity among its students, faculty and staff. An emphasis upon diversity and inclusion throughout the campus community is essential to achieve
                these goals. Diversity is broadly defined to include such characteristics as, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation. Diversity also entails different viewpoints, philosophies, and
                perspectives. Attention to these aspects of diversity will help promote a culture of inclusion and belonging, and an environment where diverse opinions, backgrounds and practices have the opportunity to be voiced, heard and&nbsp;respected.</p>
