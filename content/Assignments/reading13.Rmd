Read the following article about *p* values:

*   ["Scientific method: Statistical errors" by R. Nuzzo][nuzzo-article] ([PDF version][nuzzo-pdf])

[Reading discussion]{.h3}

Instead of posting a question as we've done for the other readings, please respond to the following prompts:

1.  Had you ever heard of this situation concerning *p*-values before this class?

    *   **If this is the first time you've heard this**, did you find this surprising, and does it affect how you feel about science?
        Explain.
    
    *   **If you have heard about this situation before**, did the article change your perspective in any way?
        Explain.
        
2.  Based on the article, what practical things can we do to make sure our claims are accurate and transparent?
    Mention any quantities that we should compute and what kinds of details we should try to include in our RMarkdown notebooks.
